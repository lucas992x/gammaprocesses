This is the code I use for my mastes thesis, still a work in progress.

## Quick info
A gamma process is a stochastic process if its increments are independent and have a gamma distribution. It can be used to approximate the degradation of objects. `gammaprocesses.py` can import data from a dataset (two are given here) and compute the parameters, or generate random samples from arbitrary parameters.

The script expects that the dataset contains inspection times and cumulative amounts of deterioration; if it contains increments of deterioration instead, the utility `incrtocumul.py` can be used to compute cumulative values and save them in a new text file.
