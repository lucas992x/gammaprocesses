This is the code I use for my mastes thesis, still a work in progress.

# Quick info
A gamma process is a stochastic process if its increments are independent and have a gamma distribution. It can be used to approximate the degradation of objects. The code is written by myself, formulas that can compute the parameters from a dataset are described by J.M. van Noortwijk in "[A Survey of the application of Gamma processes in maintenance](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222140978_A_Survey_of_the_application_of_Gamma_processes_in_maintenance)".
